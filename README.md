# shitty
A very unfinished terminal emulator for the browser.  
Built with PHP + JavaScript.

## Status
⚠️ This is just a toy project, not production-ready.  
Expect bugs, missing features, and general brokenness.

## Features (so far)
- Basic UI for a "terminal" in the browser
- Some commands kinda work

## Goals (maybe, if I ever finish)
- File manager integration
- Database-backed command history
- More realistic terminal behavior

## How to run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shitty.git
